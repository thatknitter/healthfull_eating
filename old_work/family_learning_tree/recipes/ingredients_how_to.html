		<div class="head">Understanding the Ingredient List</div>
		<p class="head-para">It can be a bit overwhelming to look at an ingredient list and assume you'll have to go out and buy all of those ingredients. 
			Because of this, we've decided to divide the ingredients into four categories so you'll start to see what you'll normally be keeping on hand, and 
			what you'll have to buy fresh.</p>
		<div class="category">Fresh</div>
		<p>Fresh means that this is some ingredient that you'll have to store in the refrigerator. You'll also be unlikely to have this ingredient on hand and 
			will probably have to add it to your shopping list.</p>
		<div class="category">Pantry-Fresh</div>
		<p>These are items that can and will go bad, but you should probably have them on hand. Things like onions, garlic, carrots and celery. Normally these
			would be considered fresh food, but because they're used in so many recipes, we consider them a type of pantry item.</p>
		<div class="category">Pantry-Dry</div>
		<p>Traditional pantry items. Things like flour, sugar, vinegars and oils, grains and dry beans. These foods are usually bought in bulk and used a 
			little at a time.</p>
		<div class="category">Herbs &amp; Spices</div>
		<p>Consider that in many recipes, a huge number of the ingredients are simply the herbs and spices that will go into your dish. You'll likely have most
			of these on hand. If you don't, it's a one-time investment that you'll use for a good sized number of dishes.</p>
